# odin-recipes
basic recipe website project
I will be explaining a simple cookie recipe I picked up in middle school
The index page will display a picture of a random cookie from my local drive. The index page will also have an unordered list with ingredients for the recipe.
Next I'll incorporate a link of some kind that will lead to a secondary page describing how the original recipe has changed over time from when I first found it till now. I will also add a page with the instructions to the original recipe and the include and absolute URL path to the website where I found this recipe.
