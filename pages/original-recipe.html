        <p>Here's what was described in the video (more or less).</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Grab your big ole kitchenaid stand mixer and throw in that butter and sugar to start mixing!</li>
              <br>
            <li>Gradually increase the speed and scraping the sides every 3 minutes and slowly add the 2 eggs, one at a time, whenever it looks halfway done throught the creaming process (around 15 mins in from creaming).</li>
              <br>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, add all of the dry ingredients together and wisk evenly to distribute the salt and baking soda in the flour.</li>
              <br>
            <li>After the the creaming process has dissoveled all of the sugar, and the consistancy is silky like, add in the dry ingredients using a siff to remove any clumps of leavening.</li>
              <br>
            <li>Add chocolate chips, but don't mix for too long or you'll develop gluten in the flour and make a tough cookie.</li>
